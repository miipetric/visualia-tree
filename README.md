VISUALIA TREE
An interactive and lighting installation that brings a tree to life. This entertaining installation suggests that man is a part of nature and that it is important to raise awareness in this harmony when it comes to preservation of natural habitats and nature in general. The installation consists of a tree which, when hugged, comes to life, expresses its gratitude with a voice message and creates light and music show. It reacts by means of sensors activated once the tree is hugged. The sensors transmit a signal, which breathes life into the tree and makes the tree express its gratitude with a voice message and light show.
